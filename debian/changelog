pollen (3.13) unreleased; urgency=low

  * README:
    - fix more minor typos
    - explain "did some work"
  * debian/rules, Makefile:
    - fix the build for gccgo
    - must use the -g parameter
    - don't strip binaries
    - these are ugly, but are the result of gccgo vs golang-go
  * pollinate:
    - remove unused variable $cmd
  * debian/pollinate.upstart:
    - our upstart job should start on starting cloud-init, to ensure that
      we get run before generating SSH keys
  * debian/pollinate.install, debian/pollinate.postrm, pollen.go,
    pollinate, pollinate.cron.d, README:
    - drop the tag and cronjob per feedback from sarnold in the code audit
      in LP: #1246098
  * debian/pollinate.default, pollinate:
    - add helpful debug info to user agent, similar to chrome and firefox,
  * debian/pollinate.postinst, debian/pollinate.postrm,
    debian/pollinate.upstart, pollinate, pollinate.1:
    - use a pollinate user, rather than the daemon user
    - by default, only run pollinate once per system instantiation
    - offer reseeding as an option, though
  * debian/control:
    - need to depend on adduser

pollen (3.10-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  * debian/pollinate.cron.d, debian/pollinate.postinst, pollinate:
    - have each client choose a random time of day to reseed,
      at first run, rather than at package installation time
    - this requires a very clever hack(!)
    - install a "template" at /etc/cron.d/pollinate, with __MINUTE__
      and __HOUR__ symbols that should be replaced by the client,
      at first run
    - cron requires that /etc/cron.d/pollinate be owned by root
    - ideally we'd run the pollinate script as a non-root user (ie, daemon),
      by specifying the daemon user in upstart and in the cronjob
    - but daemon can't write to /etc/cron.d/pollinate, if it's owned by root
    - so here's the hack...
      + the upstart job installed by the package has "setuid root"
      + on its first run (which will be either at package install time, or
        at boot), it will run as root and: a) update the cronjob to a random
        time, and b) update the upstart job to run as daemon
      + woot
      + this works because both are conffiles
  * debian/pollen.postinst, debian/pollinate.postinst,
    debian/pollinate.postrm, pollinate:
    - use /var/cache/pollinate, rather than /var/lib/pollinate
    - this should make it more obvious that this data can be cleared out,
      and should be cleared out, on re-bundles or snapshots and reimages
  * debian/control, Makefile:
    - switch from golang-go to gcc-go, so that we can get this source
      package into Ubuntu main
  * pollinate, pollinate.1:
    - separate the pool and the server variables
  * debian/control:
    - no need to depend on bsdutils, it's essential
    - pollen depends on adduser
  * usr.bin.pollen:
    - update apparmor profile to allow reading of /usr/bin/pollen
      - oddly, this was introduced when switching compilers
  * debian/copyright:
    - lintian/dep5 cleanup

      by Seth Arnold in LP: #1246098
    - big thanks to Jamie Strandboge and Seth Arnold for assistance

  * debian/anerd-client.postinst, debian/control, debian/anerd-client.install:
    - keep the initramfs code, but don't automatically update the initramfs
      for now, as this can render a machine without networking unbootable;
      re-enable this when we have a workaround for that
  * debian/anerd-server.postinst:
    - fix typo

  * anerd.c:
    - Only call srandom() once

  * debian/control, debian/cron.d:
    - use run-one for cronjob
  * anerd-client:
    - clean up client, make more modular, remove some variables, uses pipes
      to keep everything in memory
  * debian/anerd-client.install, debian/anerd-server.install,
    debian/control, debian/copyright, debian/cron.d => debian/anerd-
    client.cron.d, debian/default => debian/anerd-client.default,
    debian/upstart => debian/anerd-server.upstart:
    - split package into a server and client package, with a meta
      package depending on both
  * anerd.1, anerd-client.1:
    - manpage fixes
  * debian/anerd-client.cron.d, debian/anerd-client.default:
    - add some inline documentation
    - use the default file for setting defaults (ie, uncomment)
  * debian/control:
    - bump standards
  * debian/anerd-server.manpages, debian/manpages => debian/anerd-
    client.manpages, Makefile.am:
    - install manpages (perhaps there's a better automake way of doing this?)
  * anerd.c:
    - rename "sum" to "crc"
  * debian/anerd-server.upstart:
    - upstart needs to expect the fork
    - upstart does not need to sudo to the daemon user because anerd does
      this automatically
  * anerd-client:
    - use a $cmd variable populated with correct parameters
  * anerd-client, debian/control:
    - reluctantly add support for netcat
  * anerd-client, anerd-client.1:
    - use a default file for configuration
  * anerd-client:
    - emulate the syslog printing from the server

  [ Wesley Wiedenmeier ]
  * anerd.c, anerd-client, debian/default:
    - add ipv6 support
  * anerd.1, anerd.c, anerd-client.1, debian/manpages:

anerd (1.1-0ubuntu1) quantal; urgency=low

  * anerd.c:
    - define the default total exchange size
    - also define and use a default payload size
    - break up the total exchange to a bunch of smaller payloads, to increase
      the randomness of UDP packet ordering and timing
    - improve some inline documentation
    - lower logging to debug from info
    - allocate an extra byte for the data binary string
    - use a separate pointer for segmenting and moving through the data string
    - no need for null-bytes, since binary data could have null bytes within
    - alphabetize includes
    - change perrors to syslog errors
    - move daemon() function
  * Makefile.am:
    - fix up the build, clean out the binary and log files
  * anerd.c, anerd-client, debian/control, debian/cron.d,
    debian/default, debian/install, Makefile.am:
    - drop the anerd client in the C program entirely
    - the C program is now the server exclusively
    - add a bash script client, which can loop over a pool of anerd servers,
      and broadcast to the local network
    - recommend the socat package/utility, which is used to broadcast to the
      local network from the bash script
    - add a cron job to run the anerd-client regularly
    - add a default configuration file for configuring the pool and other
      tunables
    - remove the unnessary install file

    - added packaging
  * anerd, anerd.conf, debian/install, debian/upstart:
    - add a configuration file
    - run as daemon (non-root) user
  * anerd.c, AUTHORS, ChangeLog, configure.ac, COPYING,

    README:
    - ported from python to C
    - added autoconf/automake build
    - changed license from GPLv3 to Apache2.0 for portability to other
      UNIX platforms
  * anerd.conf, debian/control, debian/install, debian/upstart:
    - drop conf file, add options to upstart script
    - update build deps
  * anerd.c:
    - use syslog, open files/sockets only once per fork
    - catch all responses to a client broadcast
    - use a common function for salt calculation
    - implement a very simple checksum of random data
    - use uint64_t for platform compatibility
    - add entropy to pool in client read
    - simplify salt generation
    - simplify log printing
    - whitespace changes only, 80 char width
  * debian/install:
    - drop installation of default file

  [ Wesley Wiedenmeier ]
  * anerd.c:
    - use getopt for command line parsing
    - Modified code to fork twice then kill the parent process,
      freeing the terminal that spawns the daemons, added daemonize()
      function to safely daemonize the program.
    - Improved entering into daemon status by moving daemon() call to
      after intilization of server and client, so that errors
      encountered in intilization are written to the terminal.
