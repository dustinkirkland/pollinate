pollinate (4.23-0ubuntu1) yakkety; urgency=medium

  * pollinate:
    - revert revision r300, as this was the wrong fix to the slow pollinate
      problem;  as it turns out, it was the user_agent function, which was
      running apt-cache very early in boot, before the apt database had
      been created
    - as it turns out, we need the curl timeout options in order for curl
      to work properly and be resilient against issues with the network
      coming up early in boot

pollinate (4.22-0ubuntu1) yakkety; urgency=medium

  * debian/pollinate.default, pollinate: LP: #1604155
    - fix a couple of bugs affecting how long pollinate takes, and if
      it actually completes successfully
    - dpkg -l is way faster than apt-cache, when there is no apt cache
    - wait a maximum of 10 seconds
    - only log to stderr if in an interactive terminal; otherwise, just
      log to syslog
      + this fixes the odd double-printing to /var/log/syslog
    - optimize obtaining version strings by saving one pipe per call
    - source /etc/lsb/release and use $DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION, rather
      than calling lsb-release (python, can be slow)
    - add -m (max-timeout) back to curl options;  removing this option
      has caused network failures in various strange ways
    - when network fails due to timeout, log accordingly
    - ignore cloud-init package not found;  it's optional

pollinate (4.14-0ubuntu1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * pollinate, pollinate.1: LP: #1554152
    - change the failure mode of pollinate, so as to more cleanly
      tolerate network failures
    - add a --strict option to re-enable the previous behavior,
      ie, strictly exit non-zero if pollinate fails for any reason
    - we've always promised that pollinate would operate on a best-effort
      basis, improving the prng seeding when possible, but failing
      gracefully when not possible; as such, we've made good on the first
      half of that promise, however, the latter half has proven
      troublesome;  this is due to the fact that if pollinate exits
      non-zero, then its callers (cloud-init, maas, etc.) may well
      interpret the behavior strictly as a failure to boot the system,
      when in fact that's not the case;  instead, we'll clearly print
      a warning to syslog, and we'll retry the seeding on next pollinate
      service start (e.g. a reboot);  moreover, we'll carry a --strict
      flag in the case that users want to opt into the previous behavior

      + e.g. random.org, news.google.com
    - document the option in the manpage

pollen (3.10-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  * debian/pollinate.cron.d, debian/pollinate.postinst, pollinate:
    - have each client choose a random time of day to reseed,
      at first run, rather than at package installation time
    - this requires a very clever hack(!)
    - install a "template" at /etc/cron.d/pollinate, with __MINUTE__
      and __HOUR__ symbols that should be replaced by the client,
      at first run
    - cron requires that /etc/cron.d/pollinate be owned by root
    - ideally we'd run the pollinate script as a non-root user (ie, daemon),
      by specifying the daemon user in upstart and in the cronjob
    - but daemon can't write to /etc/cron.d/pollinate, if it's owned by root
    - so here's the hack...
      + the upstart job installed by the package has "setuid root"
      + on its first run (which will be either at package install time, or
        at boot), it will run as root and: a) update the cronjob to a random
        time, and b) update the upstart job to run as daemon
      + woot
      + this works because both are conffiles
  * debian/pollen.postinst, debian/pollinate.postinst,
    debian/pollinate.postrm, pollinate:

  * pollinate, pollinate.1:

  * debian/control:

  * debian/pollinate.upstart:
    - start pollinate when we have networking up and running, or
      when we start ssh
  * pollen.go:
    - drop the nanosecond timestamp collection on the server
    - a good server should have real entropy hardware, and a busy server
      will have network traffic entropy already captured by the kernel
    - Suggestion by Seth Arnold in a security review
  * debian/pollen.default, pollinate:
    - drop timestamp based salting, not terribly valuable
    - per security review by Seth Arnold
  * pollinate:

    - create two small packages, one to launch anerd-tcp->80 and
      anerd-tcp->443
      + both depend on anerd-tcp-common, which provides the go script
    - add a postinst that generates a self-signed cert if there is none;
      obviously, one would want to replace these with real certs if
      security matters to you
    - create two upstart scripts that start the web service on each port
      + means you can install one, or the other, or both
  * anerd-client, debian/anerd-client.default:
